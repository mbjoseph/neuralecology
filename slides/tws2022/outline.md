# Main points:

1. Neural hierarchical models combine neural networks with models of ecological states/processes and observations
- If you already know what a hierarchical model, a neural hierarchical model uses a neural network for function approximation (like Gaussian proceses, GAMs, etc.)
- If you already know about neural networks, a neural hierarchical model modifies the loss function to account for state dynamics and the observation process
- e.g., BBS analysis (mention scale afforded by stochastic optimization)
- e.g., ConvHMM movement model (mention flexibility)

2. This is part of a broader synthesis of science-based deep learning
- mention universal differential equations
- physics-constrained neural networks

3. Let's think more broadly about how we use deep learning
- e.g., how can we couple the output of computer vision models with ecological models?
- what are the new failure modes that we invite with deep learning?

# Hook: 

Deep learning revolution

What has ecology done with the deep learning revolution
- example applications

These applications are unsatisfying. They don't tell me what I want to know.

I don't just want to predict data. I want to learn about ecology!
- population dynamics
- occupancy states
- historical change
- demographic rates

These are all things we study with hierarchical models
